    <h2>Front End Development</h2>
    <img class="slider" src="css/images/fronend1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="200">
    <p>Front-end web development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front-end development is that the tools and techniques
      used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>
    <p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with
      varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems
      (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer</p>
